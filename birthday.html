        <h1>Happy Birthday, Ada! 🎉🎂</h1>
        
        <p>My dearest Ada,</p>
        
        <p>On this special day, I just want you to know how much you mean to me.  
        You are the best sister anyone could ask for, you're always there for me whenever I need you, from stupid things like you helping me check my outfit to helping me make life changing decisions, and I am so lucky to have you.  
        ❤</p>
        
        <p>Ada, you are such a light in my life. From the little moments we share to the big ones,  
        every memory with you is something I cherish. You always know how to make me smile,  
        and even when things aren’t perfect, you bring warmth and joy into every situation.  
        I truly admire your kindness, strength, and the way you care for the people around you.  
        You are so special, and I hope you never forget that.</p>
        
        <p>There is no one else in this world quite like you, and I wouldn’t trade you for anything.  
        I hope today reminds you of how loved you are—not just by me, but by everyone lucky enough to know you.  
        You deserve all the happiness in the world, and I pray that this year brings you everything  
        you’ve been wishing for. I love you endlessly, Ada. ❤</p>

        <p>Enjoy your day, I love you so much more than words can tell. 🎈</p>
